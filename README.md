# GomoryImproved
This code aims to solve the problem of forgetting solutions in Gomory Cutting Plane. We use the Schmidt orthogonalization method to determine the direction vector of the constraint conditions, and then perform a one-dimensional search in this direction to obtain all optimal solutions.
